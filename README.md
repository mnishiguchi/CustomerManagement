CustomerManagement
==================
CustomerManagement is a simple Java Swing application for a small-size mom-and-pop store to keep customers purchase records.

## DESCRIPTION:
- Customer Infomation consists of last name, first name, phone number, zip code and prefix(Mr or Ms). It is stored in customer_data/customers.txt(tab-separated values).
- Purchase records are made up of date and dollar amount. Each customer's purchase record is stored in customer_data/0000000000.txt(tab-separated values). Ten-digit phone number doubles as a customer id in this application.
- Upon execution, a window with the main menu pops up, where there are choices of "create an acount", "show all accounts", "search by last name", "search by phone number".

## USAGE:
- In the directory where you placed the app, create a directory named "customer_data", where customers data files are automatically created and stored.
