CustomerManagement
==================
#### CustomerManagement is a simple Java Swing application for a small-size store to keep customers purchase records.

## DESCRIPTION:
- Customer Infomation consists of last name, first name, phone number, zip code and prefix(Mr or Ms). It is stored in customer_data/customers.txt(tab-separated values).
- Purchase records are made up of date, invoice number and dollar amount. Each customer's purchase record is stored in customer_data/0000000000.txt(tab-separated values). Ten-digit phone number doubles as a customer id in this application.
- The details of the purchase is stored as an invoice, in a file inside of the invoice directory.
- Upon execution, a window with the main menu pops up, where there are choices of "create an acount", "show all accounts", "search by last name", "search by phone number" and "search by invoice number".

## USAGE:
- In the directory where you placed the app, create two directors named "customer_data" and "invoice" respectively. For instance, I create a directory "CustomerManagement", in which I put the excutable "CustomerManagement.exe", and in that directory create new directories "customer_data" and "invoice".
- Customers data files and invoice files will be automatically created, updated and stored as needed.
